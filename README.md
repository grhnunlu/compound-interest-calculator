This simple Python script calculates the future value of an initial capital after a specified number of years, based on an annual interest rate. It uses a for-loop to apply the compound interest formula over the given period.
HOW TO USE 
Step 1: Run the script

    Run the script using Python.

Step 2: Input values

    The script will prompt you for three inputs:
        Capital: Enter the initial amount of money you'd like to invest. Example: 1000
        Interest Rate: Enter the yearly interest rate as a decimal. For example, if the interest rate is 5%, you would input 0.05.
        Years: Enter the number of years the capital will grow. Example: 10

Step 3: View the results

    The script will then output the total capital you will have after the specified number of years, including compounded interest.

Example:

enter capital: 1000
enter yearly interest rate: 0.05
how many years: 10

after 10 years, your total money is = 1628.89
